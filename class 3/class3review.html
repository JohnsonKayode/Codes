        <h1>this is like the fundamentals</h1>
        <p>Lets hope it works</p>

        <h2>it worked. So i guess i can move on to my active recalling session</h2>

        <h3>Lets talk about the separation of concerns</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the rules of the separation of concerns states that the styling page or file must be different from the content page</li>
            <li>Secondly, the separation of concerns allows us keep our work neat and readable. <Span>According to leon, it would help other developers understand and read our code easily.</Span></li>
            <li>If we use the separation of concerns when writing code, it helps us write better codes and helps us understand how our code works</li>
        <p>That is all i can remeber about the separation of concerns</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Let us now talk about the use of active recalls when learning something new</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Active recall helps us refresh our minds <span>that is, when we practice the active recall, we recall or remember what we have read or saw earlier</span></li>
            <li>Acive recall helps us rejurgle or memory by bring the things we have saw in the past, into the present. By so doing, it will ake a longer time to forget what has been learnt in the past. This is one of the many benefits of active recalling</li>

            <p>I think this is all i can remember about active recalling and spaced repetition. Next, we move to The html tags</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>This is the part where we talk about the tags taught by Leon. I know there are more tags bu i think he taught the most important tags which i will share during the course of this assignment.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Section tag:</h2>So first things first, he taught us the 'section' tags: The section tag is used to differentiate differents contents within your HTML code or group contens under a single umbrellA.</li>

            <li><h2>Header Tag:</h2> The header tag is used in HTML when we have a head. Every website has a head, just as we explained in the separation of concerns, we need to arrange out code in a way that another developer would be able to read our code and understand what we are doing at a particular point in our code and why. So we use the header tag to wrap contents that are otherwise known to be at the head of a page, such as the nav bars, logos, amongst others.</li>

            <li><h2>Footer tag: </h2>Just like the header tag, the footer tag does the same hing but rather than find its contents at the head, you find its contents at the foot of the page. </li>

            <li><h2>Body tag: </h2> We also have the body tag. this tag wraps everything in between the header and the footer. It holds other necessary informations like the articles, images, sections, divs, links, amongst others.</li>

            <li><h2>Div tag:</h2> This is also used to separate contents just as explained with section tag. The only difference between them is the text or their spelling but they both carry out the same functions.</li>

            <li><h2>Article tag:</h2>The article tag is used to also create a section in your HTML code that is reserved for articles. According to leon, when you use the article tag, that means a user of the website can copy or lift an article as a whole. That is it gives access to the user to be able to copy you contents and paste. By using the article tag, that means you are going to use that part to hold long contents, Majorly texts. </li>

            <li><h2>Span tag: </h2> The span tag is basically used to hold a small amount of text. So for instance, if you have a short piece of text you want to highlight of standout in a long line of texts or contents, you wrap it within a span tag. </li>

            <li><h2>P tag (paragragh tag):</h2>The 'p' tag otherwise known as the paragraph tag, is used to hold a wide range of text. It can hold a very long piece of texts unlike the span tag that is just meant to hold very few number of texts.</li>

            <li><h2>UL(Unordered List) and OL(Ordered List) tag: </h2> These tags are used interchangeably. But there are slight differences abongs both. The UL tag, is used when yyou do not have a specific order for a perticular list. That is, the contents of that list do not follow any particular order. They are just a list of items but arranged in no particular order. The OL on the other hand works in the opposite fashion. That is, It is a numbered list, it makes use of numbers in listing items. The unordered list makes use of bullets to highlight new items on the list. So when using the UL or the OL, you mus be sure of the conext in which they are to be used and when to use them. In most cases, The UL is used often by me. Just like these bullet points you see, they are made using the UL tag.</li>

            <li><h2>LI tag: </h2> The li tag is also known as the list tag. This tag is always wrapped with either the UL tag or the OL tag. because they give the Li tag a meaning. Using the li tag outside the UL or the OL tag would make your contens scattered and without a parent. The way the li tag works is, before you can use the li tag, you should make use of either the UL tag or the OL ag, and inside these tags, you have your li tag, so the li tag knows what to do, either to highlight its contents with bullets (UL), or the numbers (OL)</li>

            <li><h2>H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6: </h2> These tags are known as heading or header tags. The are used to highlights texts in order of size. The H1 being the boldest and biggest and the H6 being the smallest. These tags are importan when you have contents you wan to highlight and make more visible than others.</li>

            <li><h2>Form tag: </h2> Just as the name implies, tthe form tag wraps a series of tags such as the input tga, button tag and the label tag</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>This is all i can remember from the class 3, up next is the class 4</h2>
