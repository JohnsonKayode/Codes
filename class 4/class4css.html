    <h3>The Golden rule</h3>
    <p>Separation of concerns. (Html,Css and Javascript on separate files.)</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <h3>Where does CSS go?</h3>
    <p>Because of the separation of concerns, we will put it in a separate file and link it with our HTML file. The only time you can use inline CSS is in emails.</p>

    <h3>Use separate CSS files</h3>
    <p>It is best practice to put css in its own file and link to it from the <head tag> <link rel="stylesheet" href="Css file name"> and thats is all you need to do to link your CSS file. </p>

    <h3>CSS SYNTAX</h3>
    <p> p (selector) { (curly braces/ declaration block) Color: (Properties/declaration) red; (values)}</p>

    <p>the whole thing is called a rule. The P is called a selector. It is followed by a set of declarations in a declaration block. Each declaration conntains properties and values. The selector, P in this case, tells the HTML what part of the HTML document should be styled by the declaration. The selector will style all the P elements on the page.</p>
     
    <p>So basically, CSS is like a bunch of rules that the HTML has to abide by. So it dicates what rule the html should follow in terms of style and it properties. </p>

    <h3>Another rule of css is that it can be read from top to bottom.</h3>
    <p>however, what is above can be overwritten by what is below. So because it reads from top to bottom, The top takes effec but if there is another declaration below that has the same properties as the one above but different value, the one below takes precedence.</p>

    <h3>there are 4 main ways to use colors in CSS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Word: h1{color: red;}</li>
        <li>Hex: h2{color:#ff0000;}</li>
        <li>RGBa (red, green, blue, alpha(transparency) ): h5{color: rgba(255,0,0,1);}</li>
        <li>HSLa(hue, saturation and lightness): span{color: hsla(0,100%, 50%, 1);} </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>FOnt family.</h3>
